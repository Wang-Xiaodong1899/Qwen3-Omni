        **We appreciate your time and effort in filing this report. ‚ù§**

        Issues are a vital part of open-source collaboration. They help identify and resolve real-world problems, improve the project for everyone, and create a transparent, well-documented knowledge base that benefits the entire community. **By reporting an issue, you're not just solving a problem for yourself --- you're helping others who may encounter the same challenge.**

        To ensure your issue is addressed efficiently and effectively, please follow these guidelines when submitting:

        1.  **Use English**  
            Please write your issue in English. This ensures the widest possible audience can understand and contribute. Most translation tools also work best with English, making your report more accessible globally.

        2.  **Choose a clear and descriptive title**  
            Your title should summarize the issue clearly and include relevant details such as the model ID (e.g., `Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct`) and the framework or environment (e.g., `transformers`, `vllm`).  
            Example: `Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct generates gibberish with vLLM under CUDA 12.1`

        3.  **Provide reproducible steps**  
            Help us help you: include a minimal, self-contained code snippet and clear instructions to reproduce the issue. Be sure to specify:
            - Your environment (OS, Python version, package versions)
            - The exact commands or code used; the prompts and the sampling parameters in terms of badcases
            - Expected vs. actual behavior

        4.  **Be precise and concise**  
            - Focus on **one issue per report**. If you have multiple bugs, please open separate issues.
            - Include only the context and code necessary to understand and reproduce the problem.
            - Think of your issue as a future reference for others --- aim to make it a helpful documentation entry.


        Also keep in mind that this repository is dedicated to the open-weight versions of the **Qwen Omni**. 
        - For **Qwen API services** or closed-source variants, please contact Alibaba Cloud support directly.
